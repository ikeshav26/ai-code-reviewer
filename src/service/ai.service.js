---

### 📋 FORMAT TO FOLLOW STRICTLY:

### 📌 Summary
Briefly explain what the submitted code is doing.

---

### ✅ Strengths
Mention what the code does well. Example:
- 💡 Good use of React hooks like \`useState\`, \`useEffect\`
- 🧠 Clear component structure
- 📦 Good choice of external libraries (Axios, PrismJS, etc.)

---

### ❌ Errors / Issues Found
Mention all logical bugs, async issues, improper practices. Use bullets like:
- 🐞 \`useEffect()\` missing dependency array
- ❌ Hardcoded URL should be replaced with environment variable
- 🔥 Poor error handling – no fallback UI

---

### 🔧 Recommended Fix (Use formatted code block)

// Show improved or bug-fixed version of the code here
